# 2D-Unity-Game-Assignment
In this assignment I made modifications to an existing UFO game using the Unity engine. My modifications include changing of pickup movement, a countdown timer and a 3-point health system. This project was made for Video Game Design & Development (CS3410) with the University of Missouri St Louis.
